<h4>Short Version</h4>
<p>
    If the dot between integer and decimal places (mm.mmm) is the only or at least the very first
    dot in the formula, then please select this option.
</p>
<h4>Why do I need this?</h4>
<p>
    The minutes mm.mmm in Geocaching denote a number with 3 decimal places. Most listings use a
    quite non-mathematical formula notation. Instead of writing 12.(x+3)(y+4)5 the mathematically
    correct formula would be: 12 + (x+3)/10 + (y+4)/100 + 5/1000. However, you will not find that
    notation in the majority of listings.
</p>
<p>
    Coordinate Joker therefore tries to interpret the first notation, too. However, sometimes it
    runs it's head against a wall, e.g. a formula like (1+2).(345-321) results in 3.24 (simply
    solving the brackets without knowing the big picture), but obviously 3.024 was intended here. By
    selecting the option Coordinate Joker will modify the above given example to
    (1+2) + ((345-321))/1000.0, such that the correct result 3.024 is obtained.
</p>
<p>
    Unfortunately doing so has one pitfall, too, because it may not be trivial to identify the
    integer and decimal part of the minutes. <b>Coordinate Joker will simply use the very first dot
    to separate between integer and decimal parts of the formula!</b> That should work well in the
    vast majority of cases, as most formulas will involve only integer numbers.
</p>
<p>
    In rare cases this may not be the case, then the option must be deselected and, if necessary,
    the formula should be manually rewritten as follows: integer part + ( decimal part ) / 1000.0
