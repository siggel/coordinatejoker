<p> Coordinate Joker is a Geocaching Add-On for Locus Map, but works also with other
    apps that can display waypoints from a gpx, kml, or kmz file.</p>
<p> Finally you made it to the pre-final after 3 hours and several miles. A final number to be
    determined: Count the planks of the bridge. Hey, where has the bridge gone? It was
    replaced by a pipe beneath the ground. What now ...? Look up the logs for potential
    telephone jokers? No, then I'd rather draw a line in my map, where the final could be
    located given the formula and missing x ...</p>
<p> But wait - Coordinate Joker will do it for you. Just enter the coordinate formulas and it
    will send the resulting waypoints to your preferred Geocaching app. With a bit of luck, one
    point will appear close to some path while the others may be far away. Then where would you
    look for the final? :)</p>
