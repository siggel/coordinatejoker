<h4>Used terms</h4>
<p>"Personal data" means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person
    (hereinafter the "data subject"); a natural person is considered as identifiable, which can be
    identified directly or indirectly, in particular by means of assignment to an identifier such as
    a name, to an identification number, to location data, to an online identifier (e.g. cookie) or
    to one or more special features, that express the physical, physiological, genetic, mental,
    economic, cultural or social identity of this natural person.</p>
<p>
    "Processing" means any process performed with or without the aid of automated procedures or any
    such process associated with personal data. The term goes far and includes virtually every
    handling of data.</p>
<p>
    "Responsible person" means the natural or legal person, public authority, organisation or body
    that decides, alone or in concert with others, on the purposes and means of processing personal
    data.</p>
<h4>Relevant legal bases</h4>
<p>In accordance with Art. 13 GDPR, we inform you about the legal basis of our data processing.
    Unless the legal basis in the data protection declaration is mentioned, the following applies:
    The legal basis for obtaining consent is Article 6 (1) lit. a and Art. 7 GDPR, the legal basis
    for the processing for the performance of our services and the execution of contractual measures
    as well as the response to inquiries is Art. 6 (1) lit. b GDPR, the legal basis for processing
    in order to fulfill our legal obligations is Art. 6 (1) lit. c GDPR, and the legal basis for
    processing in order to safeguard our legitimate interests is Article 6 (1) lit. f GDPR. In the
    event that vital interests of the data subject or another natural person require the processing
    of personal data, Art. 6 (1) lit. d GDPR serves as legal basis.</p>
<h4>Collaboration with processors and third parties</h4>
<p>If, in the context of our processing, we disclose data to other persons and companies (contract
    processors or third parties), transmit them to them or otherwise grant access to the data, this
    will only be done on the basis of a legal permission (e.g. if a transmission of the data to
    third
    parties, as required by payment service providers, pursuant to Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR to fulfill
    the contract), you have consented to a legal obligation or based on our legitimate interests
    (e.g.
    the use of agents, webhosters, etc.).</p>
<p>
    If we commission third parties to process data on the basis of a so-called "contract processing
    contract", this is done on the basis of Art. 28 GDPR.</p>
<h4>Transfers to third countries</h4>
<p>If we process data in a third country (i.e. outside the European Union (EU) or the European
    Economic Area (EEA)) or in the context of the use of third party services or disclosure or
    transmission of data to third parties, this will only be done if it is to fulfill our (pre)
    contractual obligations, on the basis of your consent, on the basis of a legal obligation or on
    the basis of our legitimate interests. Subject to legal or contractual permissions, we process
    or have the data processed in a third country only in the presence of the special conditions of
    Art. 44 et seq. GDPR. This means, for example, that the processing takes place on the basis of
    special guarantees, such as the officially recognized level of data protection (e.g. for the USA
    through the "Privacy Shield") or compliance with officially recognized special contractual
    obligations (so-called "standard contractual clauses").</p>
<h4>Rights of data subjects</h4>
<p>You have the right to ask for confirmation as to whether the data in question is being processed
    and for information about this data as well as for further information and a copy of the data in
    accordance with Art. 15 GDPR.</p>
<p>According to Art. 16 GDPR you have the right to demand the completion of the data concerning
    you or the correction of the incorrect data concerning you.</p>
<p>In accordance with Art. 17 GDPR, you have the right to demand that the relevant data be deleted
    immediately or, alternatively, to require a restriction of the processing of data in accordance
    with Art. 18 GDPR.</p>
<p>You have the right to demand that the data relating to you, which you have provided to us, be
    obtained in accordance with Art. 20 GDPR and can request transmission to other persons
    responsible.</p>
<p>According to Art. 77 GDPR you have the right to file a complaint with the competent supervisory
    authority.</p>
<h4>Withdrawal</h4>
<p>You have the right to revoke granted consent in accordance with Art. 7 (3) GDPR with effect
    for the future.</p>
<h4>Right to object</h4>
<p>You can object to the future processing of your data in accordance with Art. 21 GDPR at any time.
    The objection may in particular be made against processing for direct marketing purposes.</p>
<h4>Cookies and right to object in direct mail</h4>
<p>"Cookies" are small files that are stored on users' computers. Different information can be
    stored within the cookies. A cookie is primarily used to store the information about a user (or
    the device on which the cookie is stored) during or after his visit to an online offer.
    Temporary cookies, or "session cookies" or "transient cookies", are cookies that are deleted
    after a user leaves an online service and closes his browser. In such a cookie, for example, the
    content of a shopping cart can be stored in an online shop or a login jam. The term "permanent"
    or "persistent" refers to cookies that remain stored even after the browser has been closed. For
    example, the login status can be saved if users visit it after several days. Likewise, in such a
    cookie the interests of the users can be stored, which are used for range measurement or
    marketing purposes. A "third-party cookie" refers to cookies that are offered by providers other
    than the person who manages the online offer (otherwise, if it is only their cookies, this is
    called "first-party cookies").</p>
<p>
    We can use temporary and permanent cookies and clarify this in the context of our privacy
    policy.</p>
<p>
    If users do not want cookies stored on their computer, they will be asked to disable the option
    in their browser's system settings. Saved cookies can be deleted in the system settings of the
    browser. The exclusion of cookies can lead to functional restrictions of this online offer.</p>
<p>
    A general contradiction to the use of cookies used for online marketing purposes can be found in
    a variety of services, especially in the case of tracking, via the US website
    http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ or the EU site http://www.youronlinechoices.com/.
    Furthermore, the storage of cookies can be disabled by switching them off in the settings of the
    browser. Please note that not all features of this online offer may be used.</p>
<h4>Deletion of data</h4>
<p>The data processed by us are deleted or limited in their processing in accordance with Articles
    17 and 18 GDPR. Unless explicitly stated in this privacy policy, the data stored by us are
    deleted as soon as they are no longer required for their purpose and the deletion does not
    conflict with any statutory storage requirements. Unless the data is deleted because it is
    required for other and legitimate purposes, its processing will be restricted. This means that
    the data is blocked and not processed for other purposes. This applies, for example, to data
    that must be kept for commercial or tax reasons.</p>
<p>
    According to legal requirements in Germany, the storage takes place in particular for 6 years
    pursuant to § 257 paragraph 1 HGB (trading books, inventories, opening balance sheets, annual
    accounts, trade letters, accounting documents, etc.) and for 10 years in accordance with § 147
    Abs. 1 AO (books, records , Management reports, accounting documents, trade and business
    letters, documents relevant to taxation, etc.).</p>
<h4>Hosting</h4>
<p>The hosting services we use are for the purpose of providing the following services:
    infrastructure and platform services, computing capacity, storage and database services,
    security and technical maintenance services we use to operate this online service.</p>
<p>Here we, or our hosting provider, process inventory data, contact data, content data, contract
    data, usage data, meta and communication data of customers, interested parties and visitors to
    this online offer on the basis of our legitimate interests in an efficient and secure provision
    of this online offer acc. Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR in conjunction with Art. 28 GDPR
    (conclusion of contract processing contract).</p>
<h4>Collection of access data and log files</h4>
<p>We, or our hosting provider, collects on the basis of our legitimate interests within the meaning
    of Art. 6 (1) lit. f. GDPR data on every access to the server on which this service is
    located (so-called server log files). The access data includes name of the retrieved web page,
    file, date and time of retrieval, amount of data transferred, message about successful
    retrieval, browser type and version, the user's operating system, referrer URL (the previously
    visited page), IP address and the requesting provider.</p>
<p>Logfile information is stored for security reasons (e.g. to investigate abusive or fraudulent
    activities) for a maximum of 7 days and then deleted. Data whose further retention is required
    for evidential purposes shall be exempted from the cancellation until final clarification of the
    incident.</p>
<h4>Contacting us</h4>
<p>When contacting us (e.g. via contact form, e-mail, telephone or via social media), the
    information provided by the user will be processed in order to process the contact request acc.
    Art. 6 (1) lit. b) GDPR. User information can be stored in a Customer Relationship Management
    System ("CRM System") or comparable request organization.</p>
<p>We delete the requests, if they are no longer required. We check the necessity every two years;
    Furthermore, the legal archiving obligations apply.</p>
