<h3 id="generalFunctionality">General functionality</h3>
<p>
    Hopefully usage of Coordinate Joker is rather self explanatory:
</p>
<ol type="1">
    <li>
        Enter <b>coordinates</b> (alternatively import them),
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>possibly</b> enter <b>projection</b> (mind for unit meter or feet!), otherwise leave
        distance and azimuth 0,
    </li>
    <li>
        set <b>value range</b> for x, y and
    </li>
    <li>
        send to your desired App with "<b>View</b>" or "Send".
    </li>
</ol>
<h4 id="enteringFormulas">Entering formulas</h4>
<p>
    Entering formulas should follow general mathematical rules, but you may add ()-brackets like you
    find them in many listings, e.g.
    <b>12.3(4+x)5</b>.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Attention:</b> If the calculation results in less than three decimal places, this means in
    mathematical terms, that a <i>trailing</i> zero will be appended. Instead of e.g. 12.(34+x) with
    x=60-70 better write <b>12+(34+x)/1000</b>, such that you get 12.094 for x=60. However, it
    depends on the owner and the task, whether the wanted solution is 12.940 or 12.094. Coordinate
    Joker offers right below the coordinates to do that transformation by itself. However, that only
    works well, if the first dot in the formula is the one separating integer and decimal places of
    the minutes. You will find a more detailed explanation directly below that option.
</p>
<p>
    In addition to the four basic operations Coordinate Joker supports the following mathematical
    operations: <br>
    a^b: exponential function <br>
    a%b: modulo operation <br>
    abs(a): absolute value <br>
    acos(a): arccosine <br>
    asin(a): arcsine <br>
    atan(a): arctangent <br>
    cbrt(a): cubic root <br>
    ceil(a): next higher integer <br>
    cos(a): cosine <br>
    cosh(a): hyperbolic cosine <br>
    exp(a): exponential function (base e) <br>
    floor(a): next lower integer <br>
    log(a): natural logrithm (base e) <br>
    log10(a): decimal logarithm (base 10) <br>
    log2(a): binary logarithm (base 2) <br>
    sin(a): sine <br>
    sinh(a): hyperbolic sine <br>
    sqrt(a): square root <br>
    tan(a): tangent <br>
    tanh(a): hyperbolic tangent <br>
</p>
<h4 id="importFromClipboard">Import from clipboard</h4>
<p>
    Instead of entering the formulas manually you may try to import them from the clipboard. Just
    click the highlighted link above the formulas to get to the import page. Coordinate Joker will
    copy the clipboard content to its input line and immediately analyse it. The format should
    match<br>
    <b>N …° …' E …° …' …m …° TN</b><br>
    or with line breaks (to avoid entering °, ')<br>
    <b>
        N … <br>
        … <br>
        E … <br>
        … <br>
        … m <br>
        … TN <br>
    </b>
    e.g. N 12° 34.567' E 12° 34.a56' 12*(b+3)m 45° TN. Of course S/W/ft can be used instead of
    N/E/m,
    and spaces may be omitted. Additionally the projection part may be omitted completely.<br>
    Instead of using a *-sign for multiplication, Coordinate Joker also supports × or x which are
    widely used as alternatives in listings. Just select the desired sign below the input line.<br>
    The results of the automatic analysis will be shown further below. If the formula extraction
    fails with a red result indication, please edit the input manually to better match one of the
    desired formats until the extraction succeeds with a green result indication.<br>
    If the results contain no function names and not more than two variables, Coordinate Joker will
    additionally detect the variables and replace them with x (and y) and give you an indication of
    the replacement, such that you can assign the correct value ranges to x (and y) in the main
    dialog. Otherwise you need to replace the variables manually with x (and y).<br>
    Attention: The analysis does not really evaluate the formulas, so be prepared to obtain a green
    indication although the extraction result is wrong. Edit the input manually to better match the
    desired format then.<br>
    Finally you have to decide whether you want to transfer the extracted results to the main page
    (value ranges will be set to ??? and need to be entered manually), or whether you want to
    discard the results and let the main page untouched.
</p>
<h4 id="definitionOfValueRange">Definition of value range</h4>
<p>
    The value range can be defined by a comma-separated list of <i>positive (incl. 0)</i>
    integer numbers (e.g. if you need to choose one out of three values offered in the listing).
    Instead of individual numbers you may define integer ranges in the form FROM-TO#STEP, e.g.
    <b>1-5#2,9-11,20</b>
    will result in 1,3,5,9,10,11,20.
</p>
<p>
    If the formulas don't contain y, you should leave y empty in order not to create multiple
    instances of the same coordinate for different y values.
</p>
<h4 id="reset">Reset</h4>
<p>
    With "Reset" you can clear the formula lines. The projection will be reset to 0 and meter
    units. The value range will be preset to range 0 to 9.
</p>
<h3 id="exportFormats">Export formats</h3>
<p>
    Within the settings menu you can choose between quick settings and expert settings.
</p>
<h4 id="quickSettings">Quick Settings</h4>
<p>
    Quick settings offer commonly used presets. If your favorite app is not mentioned there, you may
    select expert settings. You may also contact me to extend presets for your favorite app in a
    later version of Coordinate Joker.
</p>
<h4 id="expertSettings">Expert Settings</h4>
<p>
    Within the expert settings the export behavior can be configured:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Use Export format to switch between GPX, KML, or KMZ.</li>
    <li>You may disable using MIME type if Android does not offer your favorite app for viewing the
        waypoints. Be aware that Android may offer many other apps then which are not really useful.
    </li>
    <li>Select 'Share' if you want to share the results via messenger or email instead of viewing
        them on your phone.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="warningsAndErrors">Warnings and Errors</h3>
<h4 id="formulaErrors">Formula errors</h4>
<p>
    An error will be shown if the formulas cannot be solved and produce no result.
    It can happen, that some x-values result in valid coordinates, while others don't.
    This case will result in a warning about having obtained less points than requested, but the
    valid points will be shown nevertheless.
</p>
<h4 id="exportProblems">Export Problems</h4>
<p>
    Depending on chosen settings Coordinate Joker sends the resulting waypoints in GPX, KML or
    KMZ format to other apps for display. Android will offer apps that claim that they can
    handle that format. So it depends on one hand on your installed apps whether and which apps
    are offered to display the waypoints. On the other hand you decide within the Coordinate
    Joker settings which format will be made available. So don't wonder if your favorite
    geocaching app is not offered in the Android app selection menu. It may even happen that no app
    is available at all resulting in an export error message.
</p>
<p>
    A further common problem is that Android may have remembered which app you selected for
    display and does not offer alternatives anymore, so you don't need to repeat the selection
    again and again. If you nevertheless want to change to another app, you need to reset that
    remembered association within Android. Details for doing so may vary depending on your
    Android version and flavor.
