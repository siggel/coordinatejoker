# Updates
## Current (official) version

The current (official) version is recommended for general use. You may experience a slight delay in receiving it, as the app is being rolled out gradually. This means that the app will first be delivered to a small percentage of users and will only be distributed further if no significant issues have been encountered.

If you use F-Droid instead of the Google Play Store, you will only find the last number of the version listed above. More information can be found under [Download](download_en).

## Current beta version

The current beta version will only be distributed to users who have signed up for the app's beta test in the Google Play Store. Typically, a beta version becomes the current, official version after a successful testing phase without any further changes.

## Change History
After an app update, the app automatically displays all changes compared to the previously installed version.
