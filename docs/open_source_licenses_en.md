# Open Source Licenses

A complete list of open source libraries and their licenses is provided in the app via menu item "About > Open Source Licenses".

Alternatively you can watch it [here](https://github.com/siggel/coordinatejoker/network/dependencies) on Github.

There is also a [Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)](sbom.json), if you want to inspect the dependencies in a standardized format.
