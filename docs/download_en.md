Google Play Store provides an ad-free version for free: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.siggel.coordinatejoker

If you prefer F-Droid over Google Play Store, use: https://f-droid.org/de/packages/com.github.siggel.coordinatejoker/

**Notes:**
* apk-files from Google Play Store are signed with a certificate that Google provides for me, F-Droid uses another signature instead, which confirms that F-Droid itself has built the apk file from my public app sources. Therefore you cannot install an F-Droid apk over an existing Google Play Store apk and vice versa (uninstalling the old one will work).
* Google Play Store and F-Droid apk files with the same last version number (e.g. Google Play Store: ...-1.2.27, F-Droid: ..._27) have identical functionality, they are just built and signed by different sytems.
